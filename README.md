## A note on versions

-   Version `4.x` supports Eslint version `>=8.x` and typescript eslint parser `^6`
-   Version `3.x` supports Eslint version `>=8.x` and typescript eslint parser `^5`
-   Version `2.x` supports Eslint version `<=7.x` and typescript eslint parser `^4`

There were many breaking changes between these versions.

typescript eslint parser supports a range of typescript versions but there can be a delay in supporting the latest versions.

This plugin only supports typescript up to the version typescript eslint parser supports. See https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint#supported-typescript-version for the versions.

The "recommended" ruleset are the default rules that are turned on when you configure the plugin as described in this document.

The name "recommended" is an eslint convention. Some rules in this plugin are opinionated and have to be turned on explicitly in your eslintrc file.

## Who is this package for?

If you use NestJs (https://nestjs.com/) these ESLint rules will help you to prevent common bugs and issues in NestJs applications.

They mostly check that you are using decorators correctly.

The primary groupings of rules in this plugin are...

### 1. Detect Nest Dependency Injection issues

The Nest DI is declarative and if you forget to provide an injectable you wont see an error until run time. Nest is good at telling you where these are but sometimes it's not.

In particular if you're using custom providers the errors can be really tricky to figure out because they won't explicitly error about mismatched injected items, you will just get unexpected operation.

These are described in the "Common Errors" section of the nest js docs.

### 2. Using Open Api / Swagger decorators and automatically generating a clients

When working with NestJS I generate my front end client and models using the swagger/Open API specification generated directly from the nest controllers and models.

I have a bunch of rules here that enforce strict Open API typing with decorators for NestJs controllers and models.

These rules are opinionated, but necessary for clean model generation if using an Open Api client generator later in your build.

### 3. Helping prevent bugs

There are some tightly coupled but untyped decorators and things like that in nest that will catch you out if your not careful. There are some rules to help prevent issues that have caught me out before.

### 4. Security

There is a CVE for class-transformer when using random javascript objects. You need to be careful about configuring the ValidationPipe in NestJs. See
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18413
https://github.com/typestack/class-validator/issues/438

## To install

The plugin is on npm here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed
You can see how the rules are used in this NestJS project: https://github.com/darraghoriordan/use-miller

```
npm install --save-dev @darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed

// or

yarn add -D @darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed
// or

pnpm add -D @darraghor/eslint-plugin-nestjs-typed
```

If you don't already have `class-validator` you should install that

```
npm install class-validator

// or

yarn add class-validator

// or

pnpm add class-validator
```

## To configure

Update your eslint with the plugin import and add the recommended rule set

```ts
module.exports = {
    env: {
        es6: true,
    },
    extends: ["plugin:@darraghor/nestjs-typed/recommended"],
    parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    parserOptions: {
        project: ["./tsconfig.json"],
        sourceType: "module",
        ecmaVersion: "es2019",
    },
    plugins: ["@darraghor/nestjs-typed"],
};
```

Note: the injectables test scans your whole project. It's best to filter out ts things that don't matter - use `filterFromPaths` configuration setting for this. See the rule documentation for more info.

There are some defaults already applied.

Note: You can easily turn off all the swagger rules if you don't use swagger by adding the `no-swagger` rule set AFTER the recommended rule set.

```ts
// all the other config
    extends: ["plugin:@darraghor/nestjs-typed/recommended",
    "plugin:@darraghor/nestjs-typed/no-swagger"
    ],
 // more config
```

Disable a single rule with the full name e.g. in your eslint configuration...

```
   rules: {
   "@darraghor/nestjs-typed/api-property-returning-array-should-set-array":
            "off",
   }
```
